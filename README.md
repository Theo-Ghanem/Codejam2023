## Inspiration
The inspiration for Productivity Boost was born from our own struggles as students, juggling numerous assignments, tests, and the constant battle to maintain organization. Recognizing the absence of an effective, tailored solution for academic workload management prompted us to create a tool that streamlined this process.

## What it does
Productivity Boost is a comprehensive platform designed to empower students in seamlessly managing their academic life. The app allows users to effortlessly track assignments, set reminders for due dates, access study resources for tests, extract information from PDFs and generate quiz questions, and even predicts expected GPA based on current grades. It serves as a personalized academic assistant, aiding students in staying organized and focused.

## How we built it
We structured the backend using Python with Flask, harnessing the power of OpenAI's GPT-4 API to extract text from PDFs and generate insightful quiz questions. The frontend, crafted with Angular, was a significant learning curve for our team due to our limited experience in this framework. Angular provided the flexibility to create dynamic user interfaces that catered to diverse student needs, albeit with a learning curve.

## Challenges we ran into
A major challenge revolved around effectively extracting text from PDFs for analysis. This required finesse in handling various formats and structures within PDFs. Additionally, navigating Angular for the frontend was a significant hurdle due to our team's limited prior experience, necessitating extensive learning and adaptation.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our team takes pride in successfully integrating OpenAI's GPT-4 API into the backend to extract information and generate quiz questions from PDFs. Overcoming the hurdles of PDF text extraction and effectively utilizing this data was a significant achievement. Additionally, though challenging, our progress in Angular development marks a valuable learning milestone for our team.

## What we learned
The project journey enriched our understanding of PDF handling techniques, especially extracting text for analysis. Additionally, delving into Angular deepened our knowledge of frontend development, offering valuable insights into building dynamic user interfaces.

## What's next for Productivity Boost
Looking ahead, our vision includes refining the PDF text extraction process for enhanced accuracy. We aim to further leverage AI capabilities to provide personalized study recommendations and extend our platform to mobile devices. Additionally, improving the user experience within Angular and expanding feature sets remain key priorities for the app's evolution.
